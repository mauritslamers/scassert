SC.Assert - simple assertion framework for Sproutcore wrapping the code in assert.js from https://github.com/Jxck/assert 
which is derived from the node.js assertion library.

By default, the assertion will not throw the errors, but rather return true or false.
If you want to have real error throwing, set SC.Assert.throwErrors to true

The following methods are available:
SC.Assert
  assert
  ok
  fail
  equal
  notEqual
  deepEqual
  notDeepEqual
  strictEqual
  throws
  doesNotThrow
